IMHO. I think ZTA would be a lot more popular, if Video Games and More was not as high-quality of a production, as it was, and is. And (improper grammar, i know) and and and, if there were fewer episodes. if I would have only shared the crummy episodes, shit man, if I would have stopped at the first one, NHL '94, with Jason Kingman co-hosting, that would have secured my popularity. Maybe even internet celebrity status. cream rises to the top, and gets dried out by the sunlight, top of the top gets cropped. I notice things. All of Zot the Avenger's fans, are HIGHLY respectable people. If only I could have stayed that way, or made myself more relatable, to all walks of life, instead of just the awesome ones, perhaps i'd have the ability to get more done. in society. oh well.

i hope you enjoy this upload, it used to be EVERYWHERE online. no joke. nothing special really. only true.
